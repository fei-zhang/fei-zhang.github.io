### A Tutorial Vieo of `ggplot` from Youtube

`ggplot()` initializes a `ggplot` object. It can be used to declare the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden. see <https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/11/14/ggplot2-2-2-0/>

`ggplot(data = NULL, mapping = aes(), ..., environment = parent.frame())`

## Arguments
  **data**: Default dataset to use for plot. If not already a data.frame, will be converted to one by `fortify()`. If not specified, must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.

  **mapping**: You can define x and y inside of mapping by using `mapping = aes(x , y)`

## Details
`ggplot()` is used to construct the initial plot object, and is almost always followed by + to add component to the plot. There are three common ways to invoke `ggplot`:


    `ggplot(data, aes(x, y, other aesthetics))`
    
    `ggplot(data)`
    
    `ggplot()`


The first method is recommended if all layers use the same data and the same set of aesthetics, although this method can also be used to add a layer using data from another data frame. The second method specifies the default data frame to use for the plot, but no aesthetics are defined up front. Therefore, you need to add aesthetics to following layers. This is useful when one data frame is used predominantly as layers are added, but the aesthetics may vary from one layer to another. The third method initializes a skeleton `ggplot` object which is fleshed out as layers are added. This method is useful when multiple data frames are used to produce different layers, as is often the case in complex graphics.

# Example1 - boxplot

_Let's make a single plot with boxplots of the average medicare payments by DRG code:_

### Step1
_Loading the data, and we can view the dataset by using `View()` or `head()`._


*`View()` can offer you a whole picture of dataset in a new window


*`head()` can list first 10 rows of the dataset
```{r}
drg <- read.csv("data/DRG_data.csv")
head(drg)
```

### Step2
_To make the plot, we need to install and library package of `ggplot2()`._

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

### Step3

_Making a single plot with side-by-side boxplots using `geom_boxplot()`. And we can reorder DRG codes by median of Average Medicare Payments to make the boxplot orderly using `reorder()` in `with()`._

```{r}
drg.new$DRG.code = with(drg.new, reorder(DRG.code, Average.Medicare.Payments, mean))
 p1 <- drg.new%>%
  ggplot(aes(x = DRG.code, 
             y = log10(Average.Medicare.Payments)))+
  geom_boxplot(position = "identity", fill ="white",col = "black")
p1
```


### Step4
_We can change the labels of the plot_

```{r }
p2 <- p1+
  labs(title = "\nBoxplots of The Average Medicare Payments \nby DRG codes\n", 
       x = "DRG codes", 
       y = "Average Medicare Payments")
p2
```

### Step5 
_We can change the format of the plot._

```{r}
p3 <- p2 +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10,angle = 90),
        axis.text.x  = element_text(size = 7,angle = 90),
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
p3
```

### Step6
_Assign values to the y axis using `scale_y_continuous` which is included in the package 'purrr'._

```{r}
library(purrr)
  p3 + 
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(3,log10(5000),4,log10(50000),5),
                       labels = c("$1,000","$5,000","$10,000","$50,000","$100,000"))
```
